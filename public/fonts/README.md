# Custom Fonts for Message Cards

This directory contains custom fonts used by the card message crafter application:

- Rockwell-Bold.woff and Rockwell-Bold.woff2: Used for English text
- AArslanWessamA.woff and AArslanWessamA.woff2: Used for Arabic text

## Font Not Displaying?

If the custom fonts aren't showing:

1. Make sure you've placed the font files in this exact directory
2. Check that filenames match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
3. Check browser console (F12 > Network tab) for 404 errors
4. Try clearing your browser cache and refresh
5. Use the font debugging tools in the UI (bug icon when hovering over a card)
6. Check font loading status in the UI (warning icon when hovering over a card)

## Tool for Testing:

The application includes special debugging tools for troubleshooting:
- Bug icon: Cycles through font styles to test appearance
- Warning icon: Shows font loading status and details
