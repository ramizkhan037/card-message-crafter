To use the custom fonts with this application:

1. Download the following font files:

   - For Rockwell Bold:
     - Rockwell-Bold.woff
     - Rockwell-Bold.woff2
     
   - For A Arslan Wessam A:
     - AArslanWessamA.woff
     - AArslanWessamA.woff2

2. Place these files in the `public/fonts` directory of the application.

3. If you have the fonts in TTF or OTF format, you can convert them to WOFF and WOFF2 formats using online converters like:
   - [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/)
   - [Font Squirrel Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)

4. Make sure the font file names match EXACTLY with these names:
   - Rockwell-Bold.woff
   - Rockwell-Bold.woff2
   - AArslanWessamA.woff
   - AArslanWessamA.woff2

5. To verify that fonts are loading correctly:
   - Open the browser console (F12)
   - Check the Network tab to ensure font files are being found
   - If you see 404 errors for font files, double-check file names and paths

**Important Note**: 
The web application cannot include font files directly due to licensing restrictions. You must download and add these fonts to your installation manually.
